"""
Main module for the QA AI Agent system.

This module implements a flow-based system for managing user queries about topics,
with ethical checking, routing to appropriate crews (RAG or web search), and
summarization of results.

GuideCreatorFlow
    Main flow class that orchestrates the entire QA process.

Functions
---------
kickoff
    Start the guide creator flow.
plot
    Generate a visualization of the flow.
