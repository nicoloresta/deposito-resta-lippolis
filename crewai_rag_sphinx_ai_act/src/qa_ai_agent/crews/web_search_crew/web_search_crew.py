"""
Web search crew for general information retrieval.

This module implements a specialized crew for performing web searches on topics
that are not covered by the smartphone RAG system. It combines prompt rewriting
with web search capabilities to find relevant information from the internet.

The crew uses the SerperDev tool for web search operations and can handle
a wide variety of topics beyond the scope of the pre-indexed documents.

Classes

WebSearchCrew
    Crew class that orchestrates web search operations.

Examples
--------
>>> from .crews.web_search_crew.web_search_crew import WebSearchCrew
>>> crew = WebSearchCrew()
>>> result = crew.crew().kickoff(inputs={'prompt': 'latest technology trends'})

    Web search crew for general information retrieval.
    
    This crew is designed to handle queries that fall outside the scope of
    the smartphone RAG system. It performs web searches to find current,
    up-to-date information on a wide variety of topics.
    
    The crew combines two main components: a prompt rewriter that optimizes
    search queries, and a web searcher that uses the SerperDev tool to
    find relevant information from the internet.
