"""
Ethics checker crew for evaluating query appropriateness and ethical considerations.

This module implements a specialized crew that analyzes user queries to determine
whether they are appropriate and ethical to process. It acts as a safety filter
in the QA flow, ensuring that only suitable topics are processed.

The crew evaluates the ethical implications of user requests and provides
reasoning for its decisions, helping maintain responsible AI usage.

Classes
-------
EthicAnalysis
    Pydantic model for ethics check results.
EthicCheckerCrew
    Crew class that orchestrates ethics checking operations.

Examples
--------
>>> from .crews.ethic_checker_crew.ethic_checker_crew import EthicCheckerCrew
>>> crew = EthicCheckerCrew()
>>> result = crew.crew().kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'smartphone specifications'})
