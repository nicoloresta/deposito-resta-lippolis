"""
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) crew for smartphone information retrieval.

This module implements a specialized crew for handling smartphone-related queries
using RAG techniques. It combines prompt rewriting and document retrieval to
provide accurate, context-aware responses based on pre-indexed smartphone documents.

Classes
-------
RagCrew
    Crew class that orchestrates RAG operations for smartphone queries.

Examples
--------
>>> from .crews.rag_crew.rag_crew import RagCrew
>>> crew = RagCrew()
>>> result = crew.crew().kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'battery capacity'})

    """
    RAG crew for smartphone information retrieval.

    This crew specializes in handling queries related to smartphones by using
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques. It combines two main agents:
    a prompt rewriter that optimizes user queries for better retrieval, and
    a retriever that searches through pre-indexed smartphone documents.

    The crew is designed to work with the smartphone document collection and
    provides relevant, accurate information based on the indexed content.

    Attributes

        List of agents managed by the crew (automatically populated by decorators).
    tasks : List[Task]
        List of tasks managed by the crew (automatically populated by decorators).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> crew = RagCrew()
    >>> result = crew.crew().kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'Galaxy S22 specifications'})
