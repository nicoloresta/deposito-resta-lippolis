"""
Manager choice crew for routing user queries to appropriate processing methods.

This module implements a specialized crew that determines whether a user's
query should be handled by the smartphone RAG system or routed to general
web search. It acts as a decision-making component in the QA flow.

The crew analyzes the user's topic and makes intelligent routing decisions
to ensure queries are processed by the most appropriate information retrieval
method.

Classes
-------
ManagerChoiceCrew
    Crew class that orchestrates query routing decisions.

>>> crew = ManagerChoiceCrew()
>>> result = crew.manager_choice_crew().kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'smartphone specifications'})

    Manager choice crew for routing user queries to appropriate processing methods.
    
    This crew is responsible for analyzing user topics and determining the most
    appropriate processing path. It evaluates whether a query is related to
    smartphones (which can benefit from the specialized RAG system) or should
    be handled by general web search.
    
    The crew acts as an intelligent router in the QA flow, ensuring that
    each query is processed by the most suitable information retrieval method
    for optimal results.
